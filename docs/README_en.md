## About Xscreeps

#### What is Screeps
*These introductions are copied from Overmind.*

Screeps is an [MMO strategy game for programmers](https://screeps.com). The core objective is to expand your colony, gathering resources and fighting other players along the way. To control your units, you code an AI in JavaScript; everything from moving, mining, building, fighting, and trading is entirely driven by your code. Because Screeps is an MMO, it takes place on a single server that runs 24/7, populated by every other player and their army of creeps. When you log off, your population continues buzzing away with whatever task you set them. Screeps pits your programming prowess head-to-head with other people to see who can think of the most efficient methods of completing tasks or imagine new ways to defeat enemies.

#### What is Xscreeps
This project is named Xscreeps, is [superbitch](https://screeps.com/a/#!/profile/superbitch)'s codebase so it's also called "sbbot", an abbreviation of "superbitch bot" and now is widely used among Chinese players.

#### Note
If you're new to Screeps, I **strongly** recommend writing your own AI because most of the fun of the game is programming your own AI and watching your creeps do their things like ants. But if you want to still use this bot, be sure you have finished reaching RCL 8 and known all activities can be done in the game in order to avoid possible issues caused by unfamiliarity with the game.

1. Better spawn function
2. Mixed role and task based creep driver
3. Chemothesis and boost with labs
